# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
Gather temperature data for the months of June and December in Hawaii in order to find if surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results
Data about Hawwaii's weather was found in sqlite file. For June and December the analysis filtered the date column of the Measurements table in the sqlite file to retrive all the temperatures for those months. Then convert the data into two different lists for each month then create a DataFrame for those months from the lists and to finally generate the summary statistics which can be seen in the images below:

![dec](https://github.com/CodyMorin25/Surfs_Up/blob/main/Resources/dec_statistics.png)

Three take aways from these summaries are:
- the average temperatures for June is 4 degrees hotter than December. Which probably means there are some cooler temps in December compared to June which isn't to weird.
- the max temperature in June is only 2 degrees hotter than December. This can show that even in the winter months the weather would be nice enough for ice cream and surfing.
- the minimum temperature in December is 56 and June is 64. In the month of December the tempurature may get a little cold but not significantly enough to affect surfing or ice cream consumption. Also the colder temps may be due to the time of day and lack of sun.

#Summary

Looking into the temperatures of Hawaii is a good thing to look into for Surfing. For ice cream sales may be higher in the summer but being cold outside won't stop people from buying it. But may want to consider going further to better understand the weather patterns because rain and even hurricans are possibilities in Hawaii. Also look into areas where there tend to be more surfers and/or find an area with killer waves that would attract surfers. There is probally data on what size waves tend to be at different areas around the island.
